# PikaTopic - a convenience layer atop Pika for use with RabbitMQ topic exhanges

## Quickstart

A RabbitMQ service ( https://www.rabbitmq.com/ ) must be running.

You also need the pika library.

```
pip install pika
```

Run this, it will listen for new messages and not exit unless you kill it.

```
$ ./examples/recv.py
```

In another window, run this:

```
$ ./examples/send.py
```

You should see output from `recv.py`.

If your rabbit server is running on a different machine, you can set the `PIKATOPIC_HOST` environment variable. For example:

```
$ PIKATOPIC_HOST=172.17.0.2 ./examples/recv.py
```

```
$ PIKATOPIC_HOST=172.17.0.2 ./examples/send.py
```

## Configuration

You will probably need to set the host name to connect to your RabbitMQ server. The username, password and exchange are all set to defaults which work for a generic server install.

Default values:

- host is `localhost` OR the `PIKATOPIC_HOST` envariable if that is set
- username is `guest`
- password is `guest`
- exchange is `amq.topic`

These may be overridden by passing any of these arguments to the `PikaTopic` class initialiser or you can change them at the module level by:

```
import pikatopic

pikatopic.DEFAULT_USERNAME = 'otheruser'
pikatopic.DEFAULT_PASSWORD = 'secrt'
pikatopic.DEFAULT_HOST = '172.17.0.2'
pikatopic.DEFAULT_EXCHANGE = 'monster'

```

## Pika Library

Pikatopic depends on the pika libary.

- http://pika.readthedocs.io/

```
$ pip install pika
```

## Examples


```
from pikatopic import PikaTopic

with PikaTopic(host='172.17.0.2') as pt:
    pt.sendData(
        "project.new",
        {
        'project_id':"12345-12345",
        'name':"The Amazing Adventures of Sausage Farts The Dog",
        'creator_id':"676867-45657",
        },
    )
```


```
from pikatopic import PikaTopic

def handler(routing_key, message, message_data):
    if message_data:
        print("%r data=%r" % (routing_key, message_data))
    else:
        print("%r text=%r" % (routing_key, message))
    return True


with PikaTopic(host='172.17.0.2') as pt:
    pt.listen(handler, ['#'])
```


## Reference

This library provides a class, `PikaTopic` which can be used for sending and receiving messages.

Unless using the `with` construct as in the examples above, you must call `open()` and `close()` before and after the `send...()` and `listen()` functions.


### Sending

```
sendText(routing_key (string), message (string))
```

```
sendData(routing_key (string), message (dict or list))
```

The `sendData` method converts the message to a json string and sets the message content_type property to application/json.

### Receiving

```
listen(handler (function), binding_keys (list of strings))
```

The `listen` method enters an event loop which normally does not return.

It accepts a handler function which is called for each message received.

```
handler(routing_key, message_text, message_data)
```

`message_text` contains the raw text of the message. If the message is json encoded then `message_data` contains the decoded dict otherwise it is set to `None`.

If the handler returns a false value, the `listen()` loop will return.

### Serverless Testing

Pass `no_rabbit_server=True` to the class initialiser to run without connecting to a server.

This might be useful for testing or transition.

You may want to also set `verbose=True`

### Verbose

Pass `verbose=True` to the class initialiser to get messages sent to stdout by the listen() and send...() functions.
